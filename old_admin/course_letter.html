<h2>Course Policies and Administration</h2>
<h3>Instructors</h3>
<p><strong>Capt Todd Branchflower (CD)</strong><br>Office: 2F46A<br>Phone: 333-6766<br>E-mail: todd.branchflower@usafa.edu  </p>
<p><strong>Dr. George York</strong><br>Office: 2E46E<br>E-mail: george.york@usafa.edu  </p>
<h3>Course Goals</h3>
<ol>
<li>Cadets shall design, build, and debug an advanced digital system. Three different approaches will be taken: (a) a fully custom-built hardware solution, (b) implementing an application-specific software processor, and (c) using a general-purpose software processor.</li>
<li>Express the tradeoffs between choosing a microcontroller versus a custom digital system.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Course Objectives</h3>
<ol>
<li>Design and implement a complex, structured, synthesizable digital system that meets defined requirements.</li>
<li>Use contemporary software tools to debug a digital system design and verify that a digital system meets defined requirements.</li>
<li>Analyze and describe the timing, clock, and synchronization requirements for a given digital system.</li>
<li>Design and implement a digital system using: (a) fully custom-built hardware solution, (b) application-specific software processor, and (c) general-purpose software processor.</li>
<li>Evaluate, analyze, and modify a given digital system to improve area, power, or speed.</li>
<li>Express the tradeoffs between choosing a microcontroller versus a custom digital system.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Course Prerequisites</h3>
<p>ECE 382</p>
<h3>Grading</h3>
<p><a href="grading.html">Grading Policy</a></p>
<h3>Course Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Course Text</strong> - RTL Hardware Design Using VHDL: Coding for Efficiency, Portability, and Scalability - Pong P. Chu (ISBN 0471720925)</li>
<li><strong>Course URL</strong> - <a href="http://www.ece383.com">http://www.ece383.com</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Extra Instruction (EI) Policy</h3>
<p>Schedule EI with your instructor if you are having difficulty with the course material.  You must have read the assignment and attempted the homework <strong>before</strong> requesting EI.  Note: You are responsible for material if you miss class, so get notes from someone in your section.  For example, if you miss the lesson where your instructor announces a quiz for the next lesson or the instructor assigns homework due next lesson, you are still responsible for the quiz, homework, or any other assignments made.  It is in your best interest to check with your classmates after an absence.  After you&#39;ve read the assignment, attempted the homework, and checked with your classmates, you may then schedule EI if you have difficulty with the material - not to make up class.</p>
<h3>CAS Policy</h3>
<p>You must request permission from your instructor for any class absence (with a descriptive reason - don&#39;t just send the SCA number) as soon as possible, preferably before the absence occurs.  You must use e-mail to notify your instructor.</p>
<h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>
<p>For all assignments in this course, you may work with any faculty members or students <strong>currently</strong> enrolled in ECE382 unless otherwise indicated.  We expect all graded work, to include software programs, wired circuits, lab notebooks, and written reports, to be your own work.  If they aren&#39;t, you&#39;ve copied and will receive <strong>no academic credit</strong> even if the copying is documented.  Further, copying without attribution is dishonorable and will be dealt with as a suspected honor code violation.  As in all courses, cadets must document any assistance received in the execution of graded work.  If you receive no assistance on an assignment, the use of the <strong>Documentation: None</strong> statement is mandatory.  If no documentation statement exists, the assignment will be returned for correction and the work will be considered at least one day late.</p>
<h3>Homework</h3>
<p>Reading assignments are provided in the syllabus and should be done prior to class. Homework problems are provided in the syllabus. It will be your instructor&#39;s prerogative to collect or grade homework.</p>
<h3>Labs / Lab Notebooks</h3>
<p><a href="labs.html">Lab / Lab Notebook Policy</a></p>
<h3>Exams</h3>
<p>All exams are closed textbook and notes.  Cadets are allowed to use only the provided TI documents and data sheets for exams and quizzes.  Both laboratory and classroom work will appear on exams.  For missed GRs, the following policies are outlined:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scheduled Absence</strong> - If you know that you will be unable to take the GR during the scheduled GR period, you are required to inform your instructor as soon as possible before the GR to schedule a make-up exam.</li>
<li><strong>Unscheduled Absense</strong> - If you miss the GR for reasons beyond your control (e.g. hospitalization, emergency leave, delayed field trip return, etc.) you must contact DFEC (x3190) within <strong>two working days</strong> to schedule a make-up.  Exceptions can only be granted by the Department Head.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Course Materials</h3>
<p>All of the course materials are open and available in a git repo on Github - <a href="http://github.com/toddbranch/ECE383.git"><a href="http://github.com/toddbranch/ECE383.git">http://github.com/toddbranch/ECE383.git</a></a>.</p>
<p>You&#39;re free to use it as-is or fork the repo and modify it to suit your own purposes.</p>
<p>I welcome any bug fixes / useful additions - please file bug reports or send pull requests as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>This course is designed to help in your development as a computer or an electrical engineer. As such, we introduce economic considerations as well as manufacturability and sustainability during the first half of the semester and re-emphasize these as we progress through the semester. Feel free to provide feedback on the lessons and labs at any time. If you have ideas to improve or enhance the course, please let me know. The class builds on concepts from the prerequisites so it is important for you to seek help as soon as you need it. Procrastination is truly the enemy in a hardware design course. A little foresight and planning and a lot of effort will result in an extremely rewarding experience serving as the basis for future microprocessor design work.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>TODD T. BRANCHFLOWER, Capt, USAF<br>Course Director, ECE 383</p>
