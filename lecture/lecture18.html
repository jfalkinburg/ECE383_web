<h1>microBlaze + CustomIP</h1>
Today's task is to integrate our counter from lecture 10 and the
microBlaze with the goal of controlling the counter from code
within the microBlaze and to display the counter output on the LEDs.
In order to accomplish this goal, you will need
to bring quite a few files together.  I will reference the 
picture below throughout the lecture in order to see where each
particular part fits into the big picture.

<h2>Work Flow</h2>
The work flow has two main steps.  Define the hardware (microBlaze + 
custom IP) in EDK and then program the resulting hardware in the SDK 
environment.  Lets start with the first step.

<h3>Xilinx Platform Studio - EDK</h3>
This step requires that you defined the logical arrangement of the component
in VHDL.  Your entity description will contain two types of connections; those
targeted at external ports on the Spartan6 chip and those intended to be 
accessible to the microBlaze processor.   The steps below describe how these
two signal types are handled.


<ul>	<li>Start/Open project
	<li>Create first repository
	<li>Add component from repository to project
	<li>Configure component
	<ul>	<li>Base address
			<br><img src="./img/lecture18-3.gif"><br><br>
		<li>Connections to microBlaze
		<ul>	<li>Add signals to user_logic port
			<li>For outputs: slv_regX <= signal;
			<li>For inputs: signal <= slv_regX;
		</ul>
		<li>Connections off chip
		<ul>	<li>Add ports to Microprocessor Peripheral Definition (.mpd) file
			<li>Add signals to user_logic.vhd port
			<li>Add signals to counter.vhd port
			<li>Add ports to master.ucf file
		</ul>
			<br><img src="./img/lecture18-2.gif"><br><br>
		<li>Define compile order in Peripheral Analyze Order (.pao) file
	</ul>
</ul>

When you hit the "Generate bitstream" button you will need to keep watch on the
Console window for errors.  I generally have to go through several iterations of
changes until I get everything correct.  Thankfully, syntax errors are caught 
early in the compile process, so once this phase is cleared, the rest of the
(lengthy) compile generally proceeds error free.

<h2>Part 1: Hardware Questions/Notes related to handout</h2>
<ol>	<li>Note: the truth table for the counter is in the comments.
	<li>Q: In lec18.vhdl, what other library must be added?
	<li>Q: In lec18.vhdl, does the use work.lec18Parts.all library need to be added?
	<li>Q: In user_logic.vhd, what do the generics C_NUM_REG, C_SLV_DWIDTH do?
	<li>Q: In user_logic.vhd, what two roles is slv_reg0 serving?
	<li>Q: In user_logic.vhd, what roles does slv_reg1 serve?
	<li>Q: In user_logic.vhd, slv_reg0 is on the left and right-hand side
		of an assignment.  Identify the two lines where this happens.
	<li>Q: In user_logic.vhd, on line 62, what is the role does X"000000" serve?
	<li>Q: If you want a signal to go outside the Spartan chip...
	<ul>	<li>What files must it appear on the entity description?
		<li>What other files must contain information about the signal?
	</ul>
	<li>Q: If you want a signal to go to the microBlaze...
	<ul>	<li>What files must it appear on the entity description?
		<li>In order for the microBlaze to read the signal, what must you do?
		<li>In order for the microBlaze to write to the signal, what must you do?
	</ul>
</ol>

<h3>Xilinx Software Development Kit - SDK</h3>
In the SDK environment, you program the hardware built in the previous step.  The
key concept here is that the peripheral defined in EDK are accessible through the
slave registers as memory mapped  devices.  For example, I assigned counter_0
to have a BaseAddress 0x83000000.  In the user_logic.vhdl file, I (arbitrarily) 
assigned counter ports to slave register according to the table below.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
<tr><td>Signal	<td>direction	<td>Slave Register		<td>Address
<tr><td>D	<td>input	<td>slv_reg0(7 downto 0)	<td>0x83000000
<tr><td>ctrl	<td>input	<td>slv_reg1(1 downto 0)	<td>0x83000004
<tr><td>Q	<td>output	<td>slv_reg0(1 downto 0)	<td>0x83000000
</table>

There are a few items of note.  First, the address of slv_reg1 is 4 higher
than the address of slv_reg0.  This occurs because the microBlaze has a 32-bit
word and is byte addressable. The D and Q registers occupy the same address
because in the user_logic file, slv_reg0 is on both the left and right hand
side of an assignment.

<h2>Part 2: Software Questions/Notes related to handout</h2>
<ol>	<li>Why doesn't the 'c' command cause the counter to count up by 1?
	<li>On line 46, why did I subtract 0x30?
	<li>After loading the counter on line 48, something should be 
		done that is missing.
	<li>What line of VHDL code in user_logic.vhd is "activated" when line 28 executes?
	<li>What line of VHDL code in user_logic.vhd is "activated" when line 53 executes?
	<li>What line of VHDL code in lec18.vhdl "activated" when line 53 executes?
	<li>What appears to be the naming convention for hardware registers?
</ol>
