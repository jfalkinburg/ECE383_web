<h2>Datapath and control - timing</h2>
There are several important reasons to examine the timing behavior of a datapath
and control circuit.  First, so that we can make informed predictions about
the expected clocking frequency of our circuits.  Second, so that we can 
identify critical paths in our circuit.  Third, so that we can develop our
intuition about the operation of these complex circuits.<br><br>

To facilitate a discussion of the timing behavior of the datapath and control
circuit, lets examine the circuit from last lecture, the search algorithm for
a minimum shown below.

<br><img src="./img/lecture11-1.gif"><br><br>

Like we did in our last lecture, we will examine the time its takes, starting from
a positive clock edge, to get the next state setup on the flip flops in the FSM.
The positive clock edge has two
primary effects: It causes the FSM to transition into a new state and it
causes the registers in the datapath to latch new values. The propagation
delay of the flip flops is referred to as Tp(A). Since the datapath
requires a valid control word before it can begin, the critical path includes
the output equation logic.<br><br>

The D flip flops which store the state of the control unit are the
input of the OEs. The delay between the application of a
valid Q to when the OEs assert their new values is referred to as Tp(B).<br><br>

The OEs of the FSM are the control word to the datapath 
telling the elements in the datapath what operation to perform.
Sequential logic components do not actually perform their instructed operations
until the next clock edge arrives. On the other hand, combinational
logic components perform their operations immediately.  It is easy to construct
  datapath instances where the control word effects the status input to
the control unit. For example, the control word selects an input of a mux,
whose output is routed to a comparator, whose status output is sent to the
control unit. Thus, the combinational logic is on the critical path because
its delay constrains the maximum clocking frequency. The time difference
between the application of a valid control word to the datapath and the
status input to the control unit becoming valid is referred to as Tp(C). <br><br>

The status input to the control unit are routed to the MIE logic.
The delay between the status inputs becoming valid and the
MIEs becoming valid is referred to as Tp(D).<br><Br>

Once the memory inputs have stabilized, they must be allowed some
setup time before the next clock edge. The setup time is referred to as Tp(E).<br><br>

<h2>VHDL Instantiation</h2>

There are two important points that need to be made regarding
VHDL instantiation.  <br><br>

<b>Binding</b><br>
The term "binding" is used to refer to the technique of assigning
signals in the top-level entity (caller) to the signals in the instance.
Up till now we have been using a verbose binding technique where
the signals in the top-level and instance are explicitly related.

For example, in lecture 10, we used the following instantiation to 
bind the signals of a generic counter to the testbench.

<pre>
   uut: lec10 
        Generic map(5)
        PORT MAP (
          clk => clk,
          reset => reset,
          crtl => crtl,
          D => loadInput,
          Q => cntOutput);
</pre>

In this case, the signals clk, reset, crtl, D and Q were defined
inside the lec10 component.  The signals clk, reset, crtl, loadInput,
and cntOutput were defined as signals in the higher-level testbench.
However, we could shorten this instantiation by using the default binding
calling convention shown in the code below.

<pre>
   uut: lec10 
        Generic map(5)
        PORT MAP (clk, reset, crtl, loadInput, cntOutput);
</pre>

The important point to make here is that when you use the default 
binding, the order of the signals must match the exact same order
that is defined in the entity description.  This generates a 
more compact instantiation statement. <br><Br>


<b>Unused outputs and the OPEN keyword</b><br>
There will be cases where you have a component that you would 
like to instantiate, but do not need all the output signals.
A good example is given by the comparator below.

<pre>
entity compare is
    generic(N: integer := 4);
    port(x,y : in unsigned(N-1 downto 0);
         g,l,e: out std_logic);
end compare;
</pre>

Note that g=1 when x>y, and l=1 when x<y, and e=1 when x=y.  If you 
wanted to know if 2 signals (say A and B) were equal to one another
but did not care about less and greater, then you could use the 
following component instantation.
<pre>
    example: compare port map (A,B,OPEN, OPEN, equal);
</pre>

This notifies the synthesis engine that it can remove the logic
associated with any of the OPEN signals and reduce the resources
used on the FPGA.<br><br>

<b>Subvectors and concatination</b><br>
There are times when we will need to rebuild a std_logic_vector
from pieces of other vectors.  In order to accomplish this you
will need to understant subvectors and the concatination operation.
Since vector are defined as signal(7 downto 0), you can replace
the limits with anything in between to get a small subvector. 
So, for example, you could ask for signal(5 downto 2) for a 4-bit
sub-vector of signal.<br>
The concatination operation, &, is a way to "glue" two vectors together.
So for example, to build a 8-bit vector you could legally
write in VHDL signal(3 downto 1) & signal (7 downto 3);<br>

These two concepts come together in the shift register used in the
lecture 11 code, which contains the following line of VHDL code.

<pre>
shiftReg <= kbData & shiftReg (10 downto 1);                    
</pre>


<h2>Keyboard serial to parallel converter</h2>

</table>

While the table implies a keyboard is an output-only device, the truth
is the clock and data lines are open collector signals. In other words, the
clock and data lines can safely be manipulated by the external world to 
configure a keyboard. A common example of such bidirectional communication
occurs every time the Caps Lock key is pressed on a keyboard. When
this happens, the keyboard sends the Caps Lock scan code to the PC and
the PC in return writes a Toggle Caps Lock LED command to the keyboard.
Since the keyboard scan code reader does not write to the keyboard,
it assumes that the clock and data signals are outputs from the keyboard.
When a keyboard key is pressed, the keyboard sends one packet of information
as shown at the top of Figure 9.14. The 8-bit data contained in this
make code is the scan code of the key pressed. The relationship between the
keys and their scan codes is not at all obvious and is not based on ASCII.
The exact codes are immaterial to the discussion; the curious reader can
perform a quick Internet search on PS/2 keyboard scan codes to get a
complete listing. When a key is released, two packets are transmitted as
shown at the top of Figure 9.14. The break code is almost always equal to
0xF0. The final packet is the scan code of the released key.


<br><img src="./img/lecture11-3.gif"><br><br>

While there is a scan code for "a" key, there is not a scan code for "A".
The device reading the keyboard interprets the make code for shift, and
then sees a make code for "a". From this, the device reading the keyboard
should understand that the user wants a capital "A". More than likely, the
user will release the "a", first causing its break code and scan code to be
transmitted, followed by the break and scan code for the "shift" key.
Each of these packets consists of 11 bits as shown in the lower half of
Figure 9.14. The data from the keyboard is always valid on the falling edge
of the clock signal. The keyboard asserts new data on or around the rising
edge of the clock. The 11-bit data packet always begins with a start bit
equal to 0. Following the start bit are 8-bits of data, transmitted 
least-significant bit first. Following the data bits is an odd-parity bit, whose
value is set by the keyboard so that the total number of 1s transmitted in
the eight data bits plus the parity bit equals an odd number. For example,
if the eight data bits are 01100011, then the parity bit would equal 1 so
that the total number of 1s would be an odd number, in this case 5. By
adding some additional circuitry, the parity bit can be used to detect errors
in transmission. Following the parity bit, the final bit of the data packet,
the stop bit, is sent and is always equal to 1.

Looking at the timing diagram and the description above, I came up with
the following algorithm.

<pre>
1. while(1) {
2.     busy=0;
3.     while (kb_clk == 1);
4.     busy=1;
5.     for (count=0 count<33; count++) {
6.         while(kb_clk == 1);
7.         shift = (shift << 1) | kb_data;
8.         while(kb_clk == 0);
9.     } // end for
10.     scan = shift[9-2]
11. } // end while 1
</pre>


Now lets build the datapath and control using the technique learned in lecture 10.
Your homework is to build the control unit for the keyboard scancode reader.
