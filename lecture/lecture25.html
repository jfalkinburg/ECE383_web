<h1>Filtering</h1>

Whenever you sample an analog signal at discrete times, you are going 
to run into aliasing problems with frequency folding.  This creates
problems in sampled systems like an ADC because noise anywhere in
the spectrum will fold back into our sampling region as shown in the
figure below.

<br><img src="./img/lecture25-1.gif"><br><br>

In order to address this problem we will utilize a principle
called attenuation.  Attenuation is the process of changing the
amplitude of a waveform without changing its frequency.  The
amount of attenuation is quantified in terms of decibels.

<pre>
	dB = 20 * log (V_out/V_in)
</pre>

<b>Question</b> If you input a 1v sin wave into a circuit
that attenuated it by -40dB, what would the amplitude of the 
output waveform be?
<br><br>

<!------------
    -40db = 20 log (v_o/1v)
    -2 = log (v_o/1v)
    v_o = 0.01 
------------->


<b>Question</b> If you input a 1v sin wave into a circuit
that attenuated it by -68dB, what would the amplitude of the 
output waveform be?
<br><br>
<!------------
    -68db = 20 log (v_o/1v)
    -3.4 = log (v_o/1v)
    v_o = 0.4mV
------------->


<b>Question</b> If you reduced a signal by a factor of 1/256,
how many dB would you need to attenuate it by?
<br><br>
<!------------
    20 log (1/256)
    -48db

<h2>Low Pass Filter</h2>
We will use a circuit called a low pass filter to attenuate 
signals.  It has some nice properties which make it well suited
to this task.  You can build an analog low pass filter by 
putting a resistor and capacitor in parallel. 


Our ATLYS boards 
have this circuit arrangement as shown by the pairs (R153, C43)
and (R154,C44) in the schematic below.  

<br><img src="./img/lecture25-2.gif"><br><br>

Strategic parameters for this first order filter include...
<ul>	<li>Corner frequency: 1/6.28*R153*C43 = 2854hz
	<li>Roll off: -20dB/decade
</ul>
 
For a Low Pass filter, the attenuation applied to an input signal depends 
on the input frequency.  This relationship is characterized in the
filters frequency response graph.  Take a moment to look at the following
<a href="http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/filter/fil10.gif">link</a>.
<br><br>

Before moving on, its important to really understand the slope
of the roll-off, -20dB/decade.  A decade is a factor of 10,
2 decades is a factor of 100.  If you increase a 10kHz waveform
by 1 decade then you would have a 100kHz waveform.  If you 
increases a 2kHz waveform by 2 decades then you would have a
200kHz waveform.  If you increased a 2KHz waveform by 2.5 decades
you would increase it frequency by a factor of 10^2.5 = 316,
resulting in a 632KHz waveform. 


<h2>Filter Design Problem</h2>
Lets test out understanding of all these concepts with a filter
design problem.
<ol>

<li>Aliasing:<br>
Your sampling an analog signal at 48kHz.  List all the frequencies
that will look like 2kHz signals.

<!-------------
This information is not visible on the web page, but can be seen
when someone looks at the page source.  Consequently, I'll put
the solutions here so that you are encouraged to work out the 
problems on your own.

1st harmonic:	2kHz			48khz-2khz = 46kHz
2st harmonic:	48khz+2kHz=50kHz	96khz-2khz = 94kHz
3st harmonic:	96khz+2kHz=98kHz	144khz-2khz = 142kHz

--------------->
<br><br>

<li>Decades:<br>
A first-order LPF has a cutoff frequency of 2kHz.  Describe
the attenuation of a 80kHz input signal in decibels and as
a ratio of output voltage to input voltage.

<!-------------
Since a decade is a multiplicative factor of 10, we need
to find how may powers of 10 you have to multiply by
in order to increase 2 to 80.  In order words

2*10^x = 80, solving for X yields
x = log_10(80/2) = 1.6

So we know that a 80khz waveform is 1.6 decades above a 2khz
waveform.  Since the LPF attenutates -20db/decade, the 80khz
waveform will be attenuated 1.6*-20 = -32db

Decibels can be converted to the ratio of output/input using
its definition...

-32db = 20db log_10(V_out/V_in)
V_out/Vin = 0.025 = 1/40
--------------->
<br><br>



<li>ADC convert:<br>
 You are working with a 10-bit ADC and would like
to attenuate some frequency below 1/2 ULP.  How many dB will be 
required to achieve this?

<!-------------
A 10-bit ADC has a range of [0-1023], so half the unit of least place
will be 1 part in 2048.

In terms of decibels this is 20*log_10(1/2^11) = -66dB
--------------->
<br><br>

<li>Sampling frequency:<br>
Given:
<ul>	<li>Signal of interest is 0-2KHz
	<li>2nd order filter
	<li>10-bit ADC
</ul>
What is the minimum sampling rate?

<!-------------
Reduce first fold-back to -66bB so that its at most 1/2ULP.
Since the corner frequency is set to 2Kh, first fold-back
to 2Khz must be reduced -63dB.  At -40dB/decade this is 1.58 
decades above 2kHz or 2kHz*10^1.58 = 76kHz.

Thus, the minimum sampling frequency is 78Khz.
--------------->
<br><br>

<li>
Sampling frequency:
<ul>	<li>Signal of interest is 0-2KHz
	<li>1st order filter
	<li>8-bit ADC
</ul>
What is the sampling rate?</ul>
<!-----------
The underlying goal here is to reduce any noise folded back
into our signal band below 1 ULP in the ADC.  Since we are
using an 8-bit ADC, we want to reduce the noise to 1/256
of the signal.  This works out to -48dB.
<br><br>

If we sample the signal at F_s, then the region between [F_s-2k, F_s]
will get folded back into our signal band.  Consequently, the filter
has between 2k and F_s-2k to attenuate the signal.  Since we have
a first order filter, we will get -20dB of attenuation for every 
decade.  Since we need -48dB, we will need 2.4 decades, or a factor
of 251 over 2k or 502kHz.  Thus we have F_s - 2k = 502k or F_s = 504kHz.
--------->
<br><br>

<li>Sampling frequency:<br>
Given:
<ul>	<li>Signal of interest is 0-2KHz
	<li>1st order filter
	<li>10-bit ADC
</ul>
What is the minimum sampling rate?

<!-------------
Reduce first fold-back to -66bB so that its at most 1/2ULP.
Since the corner frequency is set to 2Kh, first fold-back
to 2Khz must be reduced -63dB.  At -20dB/decade this is 3.15
decades above 2kHz or 2kHz*10^3.15 = 2.8Mhz

Thus, the minimum sampling frequency is 2.8Mhz + 2Khz = 2.8Mhz
Wow, what a difference that extra order in the filter made!

<li>Filter specs:<br>
Given:
<ul>	<li>Signal of interest is 0-2KHz
	<li>8-bit ADC
	<li>Maximum possible sampling rate of 80KHz
</ul>
What order filter do we need?
<!-------------
An 8-bit ADC required -48db of attenuation to get the noise below 1ulp.
From 2kHz to 78kHz is 1.6 decades (solve 2*10^x = 78)
The roll off of an x-order LPF is -20*x db/decade.

-20*x db      -48 db
-------- = -----------		x = 1.5, so 2nd order filter is needed.

<li>Signal bandwidth:<br>
Given:
<ul>	<li>16-bit ADC
	<li>4th order filter
	<li>Sampling frequency 250kHz
</ul>
What is the maximum frequency of the signal of interest?
<!-------------
A 16-bit ADC required -96db of attenuation to get the noise below 1ulp.
Let the sampling frequency be called alpha.
Fold back will occur at 250k - alpha.
Filter must attenuate signal over:
	alpha*10^x=250k-alpha
	log((250k-alpha)/alpha) decades
4th order filter rolls off at -80db/decade 

-80 db                 -96 db
-------- = ------------------------------
 decade    log((250k-alpha)/alpha) decade

alpha = 14.8Khz
